Question 4:
-dont know how to captialise every word except the first, here is the code that I researched/used ai to make it work:

.split("-")              // Step 2: split into words
    .map((word, index) => {  // Step 3: modify each word
      if (index === 0) {
        return word;         // first word stays lowercase
      } else {
        // Capitalize first letter, keep the rest lowercase
        return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
      }
    })
    .join("");

but don't understand how it works beyond split and join

therefore I don't understand 4b and 4c
